Do you want to use the same snippet throughout your site but only have to change the value in one location? If so, this plugin maybe just what you need.

[shortcode-variables slug="sc-todays-date"]	Displays today's date. Default is UK format (DD/MM/YYYY). Format can be changed by adding the parameter format="m/d/Y" onto the shortcode. Format syntax is based upon PHP date: http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php

[shortcode-variables slug="sc-site-url"]	Displays the site URL.
[shortcode-variables slug="sc-page-title"]	Displays the page title.
